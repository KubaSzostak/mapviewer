# JSHint options

This is a JSHint options file appropriate for Esri JS API based projects.
It is the same file Esri uses internally for working on the JS API library.

### What is JSHint?

It is an extended and slightly "nicer" version of the original JavaScript linting tool, jslint.
JSHint is supported in all major web development IDEs and is widely used throughout the industry.

You can find out more information about the specific options [here.](http://jshint.com/docs/options/)

You can learn more about JSHint in [general.](http://jshint.com/about/)

### How do I use it?

Most IDEs will traverse up your directory structure looking for a file named `.jshintrc`.

If you would like to use this file on a specific project or even part of a project, you should put it in that associated directory.

If you are interested in using this file for the majority of your projects, then you should put it somewhere higher up in your directory structure, such as your `projects` folder, for example.

Most IDEs will look **up** the directory structure, but **never** further down or in adjacent folders.

Please feel free to modify as appropriate for your own use.
